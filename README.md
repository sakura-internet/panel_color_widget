The panel color widget is a [WireCloud widget](http://wirecloud.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) that provides an easy way to
display simple text messages, like measures.

## Build

Be sure to have installed [Node.js](http://node.js) and [Bower](http://bower.io) in your system. For example, you can
install it on Ubuntu and Debian running the following commands:

```console
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup | sudo bash -
sudo apt-get install nodejs
sudo apt-get install npm
sudo npm install -g bower
```

Install other npm dependencies by running: (need root because some libraries use applications, check package.json before
to be sure)

```console
sudo npm install
```

For build the widget you need download grunt:

```console
sudo npm install -g grunt-cli
```

And now, you can use grunt:

```console
grunt
```

If everything goes well, you will find a wgt file in the `build` folder.

## Documentation

Documentation about how to use this widget is available on the [User Guide](src/doc/userguide.md). Anyway, you can find
general information about how to use widgets on the
[WireCloud's User Guide](https://wirecloud.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_guide/) available on Read the Docs.
